## Overview

Die-Namic Engine ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how **Final Destination Terminal** collects, uses, and safeguards your information when you use our mobile application.

**Key Points:**
- We do **NOT** collect, transmit, or sell personal data
- All game data is stored **locally on your device**
- No internet connection required to play
- No analytics, tracking, or advertising
- No account creation or login required

## 1. Information We Collect

### 1.1 Data Stored Locally on Your Device

The app stores the following data **exclusively on your device** in private app storage:

#### Game Progress Data
- **Save Files:** Character state, room progress, inventory, score, and turn count (stored in saves directory)
- **Achievement Data:** Unlocked achievements and timestamps (stored in achievements.json)
- **Game Settings:** Display preferences, text size, theme selection (stored in app configuration)
- **Session Logs:** Debugging logs for troubleshooting crashes (stored in logs directory)

**Evidence from Codebase:**
```python
# fd_terminal/game_logic.py - Save system
save_path = get_save_filepath(slot_identifier)  # Local file path only
with open(save_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    json.dump(save_data, f, ...)  # Written to device storage

# buildozer.spec - Private storage configuration
android.private_storage = True  # Data isolated to app sandbox
```

#### Technical Data
- **Crash Reports:** Error logs generated during gameplay (stored locally in logs directory)
- **Performance Data:** Frame rates, memory usage (not transmitted)

**Storage Location:** All data is stored in the app's private sandbox directory, accessible only by the app itself.

---

## 2. Data We Do NOT Collect

The app **does NOT** collect, access, or transmit:

- ❌ Personal identification information (name, email, phone number)
- ❌ Device identifiers (IMEI, MAC address, advertising ID)
- ❌ Location data (GPS coordinates)
- ❌ Contact lists or social media accounts
- ❌ Camera, microphone, or sensor data
- ❌ Browsing history or app usage outside this app
- ❌ Payment or financial information
- ❌ Biometric data

**Evidence from Codebase:**
```python
# main.py - No network calls
# No imports of: requests, urllib, http.client, socket
# No analytics SDKs (Firebase, Google Analytics, etc.)
# No ad networks

# buildozer.spec - Minimal permissions
android.permissions = WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE,READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
# Only storage permissions requested (for save files)
```

---

## 3. How We Use Your Information

Data stored locally is used **exclusively** for:

### 3.1 Core Gameplay
- Saving and loading game progress across sessions
- Tracking achievements and evidence collection
- Maintaining game state (HP, fear level, inventory)
- Generating procedural content (disasters, hazard placements)

**Evidence from Codebase:**
```python
# fd_terminal/game_logic.py - Save data structure
save_data = {
    "player_state": self.player.copy(),  # Character stats
    "level_rooms_state": self.current_level_rooms_world_state.copy(),
    "interaction_flags": list(self.interaction_flags),
    "engine_states": {...}  # Hazard/AI state
}
# All data remains on device; no network transmission
```

### 3.2 Adaptive Difficulty
- The Death AI system analyzes player actions to adjust challenge
- QTE timing and hazard behavior adapt based on performance
- All analysis happens **locally** with no external data sharing

**Evidence from Codebase:**
```python
# fd_terminal/death_ai.py - Local-only processing
def analyze_player_action(self, action_type, target=None, ...):
    # Processes player behavior locally
    self.player_behavior_patterns['last_actions'].append(...)
    # No network calls, no external logging
```

### 3.3 Crash Diagnosis
- Session logs help diagnose technical issues
- Logs are stored locally and **never automatically uploaded**
- Users may voluntarily share logs via email for support

**Evidence from Codebase:**
```python
# main.py - Local logging only
logging.basicConfig(
    handlers=[
        logging.StreamHandler(),  # Console only
        logging.FileHandler("/sdcard/fdt_log.txt")  # Local file
    ]
)
# No remote logging servers configured
```

---

- Advertising networks (AdMob, Unity Ads, etc.)
- Social media integration (Facebook SDK, Twitter API, etc.)
- Cloud save services (Google Play Games, iCloud, etc.)
- In-app purchase systems (currently)

**Evidence from Codebase:**
```python
# buildozer.spec - Minimal requirements
requirements = python3,kivy==2.3.0,cython==0.29.36
# No third-party SDKs included

# No code references to:
# - firebase, google-analytics, crashlytics
# - admob, unity-ads, facebook-sdk

## 5. Data Security

### 5.1 Local Storage Protection
- All save files stored in app's **private sandbox** (not accessible to other apps)
- Android OS enforces app isolation
- No cloud synchronization reduces attack surface

**Evidence from Codebase:**
```ini
# buildozer.spec
android.private_storage = True  # Enforces app-private directory
android.allow_backup = True     # Allows Android's encrypted backup
```

### 5.2 No Network Transmission
- **Zero network activity** during normal gameplay
- No vulnerable endpoints (no API servers, databases, authentication)
- Eliminates risks of man-in-the-middle attacks, data interception

### 5.3 Backup Data
If you enable Android's backup feature:
- Google encrypts your save files in the cloud
- Governed by [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
- You can disable backups in Android Settings → System → Backup

def delete_save_game(self, slot_identifier):
    save_path = get_save_filepath(slot_identifier)
    if os.path.exists(save_path):
        os.remove(save_path)  # Permanent deletion
```

### 6.3 Data Portability
