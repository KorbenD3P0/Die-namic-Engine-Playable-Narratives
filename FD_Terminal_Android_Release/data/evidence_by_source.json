They watch in stunned horror as the Boeing 747 explodes just as Alex foresaw. Their relief is short-lived. After his best friend Tod dies in a bizarre \"suicide,\" a cryptic mortician, William Bludworth, informs Alex and fellow survivor Clear Rivers that they have only delayed the inevitable. They have ruined Death's design, and now Death is coming to reclaim their lives in the order they were meant to die. The survivors are then hunted one by one: Terry is obliterated by a bus, and their teacher, Ms. Lewton, is impaled by a kitchen knife before her house explodes.\n\nAlex realizes that by observing omens, they can intervene. He manages to save Carter from an oncoming train, but this only disrupts the order. Death skips Carter and immediately decapitates Billy with shrapnel from the wreckage. Realizing Clear is actually next, Alex races to save her, sacrificing himself by grabbing a live wire to free her from an exploding car. He survives, and six months later, the remaining trio—Alex, Clear, and Carter—meet in Paris, believing they've finally cheated the design. As they celebrate, a giant neon sign breaks loose. Carter shoves Alex to safety, but as he asks who's next, the sign swings back down, crushing him and proving that Death's plan is still very much in action.",

She stalls her car, blocking the on-ramp and saving several people, including Officer Thomas Burke. Moments later, the pileup occurs, and Kimberly's own car is obliterated, killing her friends inside. The survivors are stunned, but soon, Death's pattern resumes. Evan Lewis is impaled by a fire escape ladder, and Tim Carpenter is crushed by a falling pane of glass. Kimberly and Thomas seek help from Clear Rivers, the last survivor of Flight 180, who, along with the mortician Bludworth, informs them that \"only new life can defeat death.\" They believe this refers to Isabella, a pregnant survivor, whose baby could disrupt the design.\n\nThe survivors are hunted down in a series of gruesome accidents: Nora is decapitated by an elevator, and Kat is impaled by a pipe after a car crash, which in turn leads to an explosion that slices Rory to pieces. Believing Isabella's newborn has saved them, the group relaxes until Clear and Eugene are killed in a hospital explosion. Realizing she must be the \"new life,\" Kimberly intentionally drowns herself in a lake and is resuscitated, believing she and Thomas have finally cheated Death. Months later, however, they learn that another survivor, Brian, was saved by Rory during the car crash. This intervention means the chain was never broken. As this realization dawns, a barbecue grill explodes, killing Brian and proving Death's design is still grimly unfolding.",

Moments later, they watch in horror as the premonition comes true, killing Wendy's boyfriend and everyone else onboard. Weeks later, Kevin suggests that, like the survivors of Flight 180, Death is now hunting them.

He frantically convinces his girlfriend Lori and friends Hunt and Janet to leave, along with a handful of other spectators. A security guard, George Lanter, intercepts the angry group just as the disaster unfolds exactly as Nick foresaw. Death's design, however, is merely delayed. The survivors begin to die in gruesome, improbable ways: Nadia is obliterated by a flying tire, Carter is dragged and blown apart by his tow truck, and Samantha is impaled by a rock launched from a lawnmower. After witnessing omens of each death, Nick and Lori research past incidents, realizing they are victims of a pattern—Death is hunting them down. They manage to convince George of the danger, and the trio attempts to warn the remaining survivors.\n\nTheir efforts are mostly futile: Andy is diced by a flying oxygen tank and Hunt is disemboweled by a pool drain, though they successfully rescue Janet from a malfunctioning car wash. The chain remains unbroken, as survivor Jonathan is crushed by a bathtub and George is fatally struck by an ambulance. Nick then has another premonition of a deadly explosion at a mall cinema. He races to the scene and, believing he's finally cheated the design, saves Lori and Janet by stopping the fire. Two weeks later, the trio believes they are safe. But Nick realizes too late that the mall premonition was a red herring. Death's true plan is revealed as a truck swerves, crashes into the cafe they are in, and brutally kills all three, finally closing the books on the McKinley Speedway survivors.",

A cryptic coroner, William Bludworth, warns the survivors that Death is now hunting them. The warning is ignored until Candice dies in a horrifying gymnastics accident, and Isaac is killed by a falling Buddha statue after a fire at a massage parlor. Bludworth then reveals a new rule: they can steal the lifespan of someone else by killing them. This knowledge causes Peter, grieving Candice, to snap.

Fifty years later, her granddaughter, Stefani Reyes, is plagued by nightmares of the event. Stefani visits the now-reclusive Iris, who explains that Death is hunting the descendants of those who were never meant to survive, including their own family. To prove it, Iris allows a bizarre accident to impale and kill her. Stefani, now a believer, watches as the curse unfolds: her uncle Howard is killed by a lawnmower, and her cousin Julia is crushed in a garbage truck.

He warns them that to survive, one must either take another's life or die and be revived.\n\nThe family's attempts to intervene only worsen things: Erik's plan to kill his allergic brother Bobby backfires, resulting in Erik being crushed by an MRI machine and Bobby being impaled by a vending machine coil.

Her frantic warning is mostly ignored, but she is dragged outside by the club's bouncer, Sebastian Lebecque, just as the disaster unfolds.

In the present day, journalist Patti Fuller has a premonition of a terrorist bombing on the subway, saving herself and a small group of strangers. As the survivors—Hal Ward (pinned and drowned in a flash flood), Zack Halloran (vertically severed by a glass pane), Susan Fries (partially incinerated by thermite), Al Kinsey (beheaded by a hubcap mid-fellatio), and her boyfriend Will Sax (impaled and decapitated by projectile CDs)—are killed off one by one, Patti's investigation into their deaths leads her to her own family history. She discovers she is the great-great-granddaughter of a woman who also cheated Death.\n\nIn Victorian England, her ancestor, Juliet Collins, had a premonition of the Mornington Crescent house exploding, saving a group of people. They, too, were then hunted by Death. The survivors—Matthew Upton (impaled and incinerated by a pipe), Hector Barnes and Jane Stanley (both killed by poisonous cobras), Andrew Caine (swarmed by cobras), and Stewart Tubbs (autopsied alive)—were picked off in order. The horrifying twist Patti uncovers is that the final survivor Juliet saved was Bill Sangster, a man who is revealed to be the infamous Jack the Ripper. Juliet's premonition not only saved him, but allowed him to continue his killing spree, corrupting Death's design.\n\nTo save herself, Patti must learn how her ancestor finally broke the chain. The story culminates in parallel climaxes: Juliet confronts Jack (who is ultimately crushed by drawbridge gears), and she herself is drowned in the Thames only to be revived. In the present, Patti, as the final survivor, emulates her ancestor by intentionally dying from an anesthesia overdose and being resuscitated, finally cheating Death.",

While riding the subway, Danny King has a terrifying premonition of the train derailing, killing them all in gruesome ways. His panic forces the group and their elderly host, Mary-Beth Bradbury, off the train just moments before the crash. Their story attracts the attention of Kate Shelley, a medical student who, after her own near-death experience during a \"Sux racing\" game, has become an unwitting servant of Death, drawn to those who have cheated the design.\n\nDeath's pattern begins, often with Kate's mysterious appearance nearby. Rinoka is the first to die, crushed in a hospital when an overflowing bathtub from the floor above crashes through her ceiling (described in PAINSTAKING detail how she is basically squished empty like a tube of toothpaste open at both ends). Next, Peter is at a zoo when a fire breaks out. He is blasted by a misguided firehose and impaled through the torso by the horns of a gazelle when he lands in its enclosure. He is followed by Jack Cohen, a 99-year-old man who accidentally falls, impaling his eye on a corkscrew and pulling out part of his brain thinking it was just a scratch. The trip's host, sweet old Mary-Beth, is later brutally trisected by a fallen corded chainsaw wrapping around a lightpole like a tetherball, and in a single, bizarre chain reaction, Bodil and James are both thrown into a department store display and impaled by a storm of sharp umbrellas.\n\nRealizing her role as Death's unwilling agent, Kate commits suicide with a syringe to save the final survivors. Soon after, Louise is accidentally injected with lidocaine and dies, but she is successfully resuscitated, seemingly breaking the chain. Months later, Louise and Danny go mountain biking. Thinking they are free, Louise \"accidentally\" cuts the brake line on Danny's bike. He is sent hurtling off a cliff into a ravine, as Louise, having taken Kate's place as Death's servant, fulfills the final part of the design.",

He believes he's safe, only to be killed moments later on his drive home when a van loses control, lands on his car, and crushes him, confirming Death's \"third time's the charm\" rule.\n\nSoon after, a group gathers for the same elevator: impulsive partier Allie Goodwin and her responsible new husband Tom Gaines; a showgirl named Shawna Engles and her burnt-out cop boyfriend, Detective Warren Ackerman; and a gambling addict named Arlen Ploog. As they board, Allie has a terrifying premonition of the elevator cables snapping and the car plummeting, killing them all.

Shawna is the first to die. Her Magipalooza! magic show is temporarily postponed, and a chain reaction on her way through the empty casino causes a prize car to roll off the stage, ramming her into a \"Lucky 7\" slot machine and impaling her through the head and out the mouth with the coin dispenser tray. Next is Detective Ackerman, who, along with his partner Isabelle Montoya, tracks a child killer to a motel. During a gunfight in a storm, a stray bullet and damaged wiring cause a live cable from a neon sign to fall into a puddle, electrocuting Warren to death. The third survivor, Arlen, paranoid and drunk, hires a prostitute. A bizarre chain reaction in the motel room causes him to make her to bite down during oral sex, severing his penis and leaving him to bleed out. Allie and Tom try to flee Las Vegas, but their truck gets a flat tire on a dark highway. As Tom is changing it, a distracted truck driver veers off the road and hits him, killing him instantly.\n\nThis leaves Allie, the visionary, as the final survivor. ...until it's revealed that on the way to the hospital after the elevator disaster, a street light dropping on the responding officer, Sean Murphy, through the roof of the SUV and bisecting him. His blood—which was HIV-positive—sprayed everywhere, completely drenching both Allie and Detective Montoya.

He intervenes, saving Amy's life and killing the attacker, \"John Doe,\" in self-defense. They soon discover the killer's journal, which reveals a ritualistic plan to murder five celebrities, each representing one of the five senses, to \"purify the city\". Realizing Death has now stepped in to claim the killer's intended victims, Jack and Amy race to warn them. They are too late for the first victim, reporter Chelsea Cox (Sight), who is impaled through both eyes by a massive, dagger-like icicle that snaps off a phone line during a live broadcast. Next is garbage mogul Dawson Donahue (Smell), who scoffs at Jack's warning. That night, a gas leak in his home fills his basement garage; when he uses his remote key, a spark ignites the fumes, causing his Mercedes to explode and crush him against the wall.\n\nThe third victim is celebrity chef Dominique Swann (Taste). Jack and Amy warn her at a restaurant, where Amy saves her from choking on a piece of food. Death reroutes immediately: a chain reaction causes an alcohol bottle on a nearby trolley to explode, launching a thick shard of glass across the room. It flies directly into Dominique's open mouth, impaling her through the throat and killing her mostly via drowning. They successfully save the fourth victim, talk-show host Katie Astin (Touch), from a bizarre accident involving a malfunctioning hot dog cart. However, Death is not finished. During the taping of her show the next day, a falling lighting rig is caught by its power cables. A separate spotlight then explodes, blinding Katie with glass shards. Groping in panic, she stumbles and grabs the live, fallen rig, which electrocutes her to death in front of her studio audience.\n\nThe fifth victim, producer Joshua Cornell III (Hearing), also survives an initial attempt when his stereo equipment collapses. But the headphone cable trips him, and as he falls, the main speaker explodes. This launches a platinum record like a frisbee, which decapitates him at the jawline. Jack and Amy realize the killer's sixth victim, representing the \"sixth sense,\" was Jack himself, the one who had the vision. Believing the danger is over, they return to Amy's apartment. But the list has restarted. Amy slips on spilled coffee and falls, fatally impaling her chest on the sharp, pointed beak of one of her own metal sculptures. As a horrified Jack holds her, Amy's distraught partner, Beriev, bursts in. Mistakenly believing Jack attacked her, Beriev shoots Jack multiple times, killing him and tragically completing Death's design.",
